  I met Avdi in 2011 at RubyConf in New Orleans. I was no one special, just an anonymous nerd who'd been browbeat into giving a talk or two. Jim Weirich had seen one of these talks and was determined that Avdi and I should meet. His introduction led to one of those arm-waving, session-skipping hallway conversations that expand minds and change lives. The three of us were so animated I'm surprised we weren't roundly shushed and permanently banned from
the foyer.

Writing today, that moment floods back. Our island of conversation, the conference
swirling around us, Jim's infectious enthusiasm and Avdi's earnest intensity. I could
not believe I was standing there. It did not seem possible to be that lucky. I thought
I'd died and gone to programmer's heaven.

I confessed that I was working on a book, "Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby", and Avdi graciously offered to read it. The word "read" vastly understates his
efforts. Not only did he give feedback about the ideas but he went through the Ruby,
line by line, correcting errors and improving code. When I thank him he makes excuses that dismiss his efforts, but happily, here I have the floor and can tell you
how kind he is without fear of interruption.

And so, it is my great pleasure to introduce "Confident Ruby". Avdi's clarity of
thought shines throughout this book. His vision of how methods should be
organized provides a clear structure in which to think about code, and his recipes
give straightforward and unambiguous guidance about how to write it.

He has a gift for illustrating the rigorously technical with the delightfully whimsical.
In this book there are bank accounts, certainly, but there's also a bibliophile meet-
up named "Bookface", and, deep inside, just when you might need a break, you'll
find "emergency kittens". Indeed. His genius is to make the lighthearted example
both useful and plausible.

Writing a book is hard work and motivations to do so run deep. In some
fundamental way the drive to teach, to explain, to improve oneself and thereby the
world, underlies all. I asked Avdi what made him write this book and he answered
me with an email containing a number of reasons, two of which I'll share. He said
"Explaining things is fun" but he also said "The truth is, this community has been so
good to me that I live in a constant state of wondering why they are so nice, and
wishing I could do more".

A sense of fun and a feeling of obligation; that's it, now you know him.
Avdi writes code that is easy to understand; in Confident Ruby he teaches us how to
do the same. Among programmers, there is no higher praise.
Enjoy the book.
