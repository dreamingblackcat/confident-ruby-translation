 In January of 2010 I gave the first tech talk of my life to a roomful of Ruby hackers in
Baltimore, MD. I called the talk "Confident Code", and it distilled some notes I'd
collected from my experience working on established Ruby codebases.
Since then I've given variations on that presentation at least half a dozen times at
various conferences and meet-ups. To this day it is the talk that I receive the most
positive feedback on. For years I've wanted to revisit, revise, and expand on that
material in a longer format. The book you're reading is the realization of that desire.
There are so many people who have helped make this book a reality that it's hard to
know where to begin.
First of all, thank you to all the people who saw the talk and encouraged me to turn
it into a book in the first place. I don't remember everyone who did, but Mike
Subelsky was almost certainly the first.
A huge thank you to Sandi Metz and Noel Rappin for reading early drafts and
playing editor. The book is substantially more readable thanks to their feedback.

Also to Dave Copeland, whose technical insights helped clarify a number of the
patterns.
To my fellow Ruby Rogues Chuck Wood, James Gray, David Brady, Josh Susser, and
Katrina Owen: some of you provided feedback, and all of you gave me moral support
and a ready sounding board for my ideas. Thank you.
To all the many, many people who read beta versions of the book and gave me
feedback and errata both large and small: if this book looks like a professional effort
rather than the jottings of an absent-minded hacker, it's because of you. In no
particular order: Dennis Sutch, George Hemmings, Gerry Cardinal III, Evgeni
Dzhelyov, Hans Verschooten, Kevin Burleigh, Michael Demazure, Manuel Vidaurre,
Richard McGain, Michael Sevestre, Jake Goulding, Yannick Schutz, Mark Ijbema,
John Ribar, Tom Close, Dragos .M, Brent Nordquist, Samnang Chhun, Dwayne R.
Crooks, Thom Parkin, and Nathan Walls. I am certain I have missed some names,
and if yours is one of them I sincerely apologize. Know that your contribution is
greatly valued.
Many thanks to Ryan Biesemeyer and Grant Austin, who donated e-reader hardware
so that I could make sure the book looks good on all platforms.
Thanks to Benjamin Fleischer and Matt Swanson for volunteering their projects as
refactoring guinea pigs.
Finally, thank you as always to Stacey for inspiring and encouraging me every day.
And to Lily, Josh, Kashti, Ebba and Ylva, who daily teach me the meaning of joy.
